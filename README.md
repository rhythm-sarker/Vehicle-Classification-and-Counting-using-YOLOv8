Introduction: 
This code is designed to classify and track vehicles in a video using the YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once) model for object detection and a custom tracking algorithm. It focuses on identifying vehicles, counting them as they cross predefined lines, and determining the direction of movement (either "up" or "down").
Traffic management has become increasingly important as urbanization and the number of vehicles on the road continue to rise. Congestion, accidents, and traffic violations are growing concerns that necessitate advanced solutions for monitoring and controlling traffic flow. Traditional traffic surveillance systems, such as manual vehicle counting or fixed sensors, have several limitations, including low accuracy, high labor costs, and inability to operate efficiently in real time. With the advent of deep learning and computer vision technologies, there has been a significant leap forward in the automation of traffic management systems.
This project focuses on developing an automated vehicle detection, tracking, and counting system using the YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once) model, one of the most advanced and efficient object detection algorithms. YOLOv8 is renowned for its real-time performance and high accuracy, making it an ideal choice for traffic monitoring applications. In this project, YOLOv8 detects vehicles like cars, trucks, and buses from video footage, assigns bounding boxes to these vehicles, and tracks their movement across frames.
The primary objective of this project is to develop an accurate, efficient, and real-time solution for vehicle detection, tracking, and counting. The project aims to be lightweight enough to operate in real-time scenarios, making it suitable for deployment in smart traffic management systems, where timely data is crucial for effective decision-making. By providing real-time insights into traffic flow, this system could significantly enhance traffic control, congestion management, and urban planning efforts.

Objective of the Code:
The code aims to detect and classify vehicles in a traffic video using the YOLOv8 object detection model. It tracks each vehicle's movement across frames by assigning unique IDs to them. The primary objective is to monitor the direction of vehicle movement, whether upward or downward, by analyzing when vehicles cross predefined lines. It provides real-time visual feedback by drawing lines, circles, and IDs on the video frames. The code also counts vehicles crossing the lines to offer insights into traffic flow. It aims to assist traffic monitoring applications like traffic density estimation and congestion analysis. The ultimate goal is to gather useful data for traffic management and road planning purposes.
